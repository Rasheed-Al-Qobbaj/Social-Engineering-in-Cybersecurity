# Social Engineering in Cybersecurity

This repository contains the final report and presentation slides for our project on social engineering in the context of cybersecurity. Our research delves into the critical threats posed by social engineering attacks, the technologies involved, and effective countermeasures.

## Project Overview

### Abstract

This project explores the significant threat posed by social engineering attacks. As the digital world becomes increasingly interconnected, protecting data from unauthorized access and manipulation has become paramount for individuals, organizations, and governments. Our study examines the methods attackers use to manipulate human psychology and bypass security measures, focusing on the case of Evaldas Rimasauskas's $100 million scam against Facebook and Google. We discuss the technologies involved, such as OSINT and spear phishing, and present a comprehensive review of related research papers. The findings underscore the need for continuous vigilance and enhanced training to mitigate the risks associated with social engineering.

## Introduction
Cybersecurity is the safeguard of the use of computers, networks, programs, and software information from damage, access, attacks, and other unauthorized activities. With the growing interconnectedness of the world, data security is vital for individuals, organizations, and governments.

## Background
Social engineering is the process of influencing people to bypass security features on computers, networks, and information. It primarily attacks human psychology, making it a major concern in cybersecurity.

## Key Aspects of Social Engineering
### Scouting for Information, Targets, and Vulnerabilities
Attackers gather information on targets, including social identities, organizational structures, and security policies.

### Social Skills for Manipulation, Lying, and Detecting Social Cues
Social engineers manipulate targets by impersonating trusted individuals and using social cues to deceive them.

### Technical Skills to Use Hacking Techniques
Technical skills supplement social engineering attacks, making them more believable and effective.

## Technologies Involved in Social Engineering
### OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)
OSINT involves gathering information from publicly available sources to craft targeted attacks.

### Spear Phishing
Spear phishing is a targeted attempt to steal sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy source.

## Research Papers and Opinions
We reviewed several research papers to understand the psychological and technical aspects of social engineering and its impacts.

## Case Study: Evaldas Rimasauskas
### Overview
Rimasauskas scammed $100 million from Facebook and Google by exploiting vulnerabilities in their verification protocols and over-reliance on email communication.

### Analysis
The case highlights the importance of verification protocols and the dangers of over-reliance on email for financial transactions.

### Impact
The scam resulted in significant financial losses and emphasized the need for enhanced security measures.

## Motivation and Research Question
We aim to understand the extent to which social engineering threatens cybersecurity and explore effective countermeasures.

## Threats and Risks
Social engineering poses risks such as financial loss, data breaches, reputation damage, and operational disruption.

## Countermeasures
### Technical Level
Implementing multi-factor authentication and other technical defenses.

### Managerial Level
Regular training programs and awareness campaigns.

### Individual Level
Educating individuals to recognize and avoid suspicious links and requests.

## Future Trends and Challenges
### Evolving Tactics
Attackers are increasingly using AI to enhance their tactics.

### Increased Accuracy in Targeting
Remote workers are becoming prime targets due to less secure networks.

## Conclusion
Continuous vigilance and training are essential to mitigate the risks associated with social engineering.
